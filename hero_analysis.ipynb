    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "This analysis project focuses on exploring Marvel and DC superheroes using two datasets. The first dataset investigates hero popularity, longevity, and diversity aspects such as gender and sexual orientation. The second dataset dives into superhero movie industry by analyzing imdb and tamatoes ratings. By merging these datasets, the analysis aims to uncover the relationship between comic book heroes and movies those portrayed in.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Main Research questions:\n",
    "1. Impact of Gender on Hero Alignment\n",
    "Understanding whether gender influences hero alignment requires analyzing how characters are aligned based on their gender. For instance, examining whether female characters are more inclined towards being good or evil compared to male characters. This analysis involves studying the distribution of character alignments across genders. However, conclusions drawn may vary based on the specific comic book universe, character arcs, and writers' perspectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Attention to Gender and Sexual Minority (GSM) by Marvel vs. DC\n",
    "Assessing the focus on GSM characters involves comparing the representation of gender and sexual minority characters between Marvel and DC comics. This analysis includes evaluating the number of GSM characters in each universe, their prominence in storylines, their portrayal (positive or stereotypical), and the impact of these characters on the overall narrative. Quantitative data on GSM character representation and qualitative analysis of their storylines could help draw comparisons between the two comic book publishers.  \n",
    "3. Superhero Movie Genre and Ratings\n",
    "Analyzing superhero movie genres and their ratings involves examining the relationship between the genre of the movie (e.g., action, adventure, sci-fi) and the average ratings received. This analysis requires statistical methods to determine whether specific genres consistently receive higher ratings compared to others. Factors like audience preferences, storytelling, visual effects, and adherence to genre tropes could influence ratings. For instance, exploring whether action-packed superhero movies tend to receive higher or lower ratings compared to those focused on character-driven narratives."

The 'ID' feature demonstrates that characters with a 'Public Identity' tend to exhibit higher probabilities of being 'Good Characters,' contrasting those with 'Secret Identity.' Similarly, 'ALIVE' portrays a trend where living characters are more likely to be perceived as 'Good Characters' compared to deceased ones. Additionally, 'SEX' suggests a propensity for 'Female Characters' to lean towards being perceived as 'Good Characters' compared to their male counterparts.\n",

    "# 5.Conclusion:   \n",
    "1. From the chart, it's evident that gender has some influence on the alignment of heroes. Transgender characters are exclusively categorized as \"Bad,\" which might suggest a specific portrayal or narrative in storytelling. Male characters demonstrate a larger percentage in the \"Bad\" category compared to female characters, indicating a potential bias or tendency toward portraying male characters in morally ambiguous or antagonistic roles. Notably, genderfluid characters predominantly fall under \"Neutral\" or \"Good\" alignments, suggesting a more varied or less stereotypical portrayal. Overall, while there seems to be some impact, additional analysis and exploration are crucial to better understand the relationship between gender and hero alignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Based on the observation from the chart, it's apparent that Marvel portrays a larger number of heroes falling within gender and sexual minority categories compared to DC. Specifically, Marvel encompasses a more diverse representation across various gender and sexual minority types in their hero roster compared to DC. The absence of heroes falling under other GSM types within DC indicates a potential disparity in the representation of these minorities between the two comic publishers. As a conclusion, Marvel appears to have a comparatively more pronounced focus on gender and sexual minority representation in their superhero lineup compared to DC.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Comedy tends to have the highest average ratings among superhero movie genres. This could be attributed to its wider appeal and relatability to diverse audiences. Conversely, Crime genres often portray darker themes and complex narratives, potentially limiting their audience reach and impacting their overall ratings, leading to lower average scores."
